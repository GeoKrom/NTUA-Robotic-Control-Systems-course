# Robotic Control Systems

Semester project for cource DPMS_AS/2104 - Robotic Control Systems, School of Mechanical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens.

The project consists of the design and kinematic simulation of a 6DoF KUKA Robot Manipulator.

## Theoritical Analysis

In this section of the project was performed the forward and inverse kinematics as well the forward differential and inverse differential kinematics.

## Kinematic Simulation

In this section of the project, trajectories were designed with 5th degree polynomial, which has continious velocity trajectory. The kinematic simulation was performed with the use of the incremental algorithm.

### How to run

In a MATLAB or Octave Environment open the folder with the code and run the command line
```bash
   main
```
